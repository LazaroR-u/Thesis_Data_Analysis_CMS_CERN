# Thesis_Data_Analysis_CMS_CERN
This repository contains the code used for the analysis of current data generated by the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. This analysis is an integral part of my undergraduate physics thesis project, conducted at the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla.
